# Introduction
> The idea behind this mod is to allow the player to capture animals in one location and release them
> to another location.
> Animals are easily found but hard to take anywhere. Using rope to lead them works, but is slow and
> painful and frequently breaks. Also if you pass by a ravine, the animal could fall down and
> damage/kill itself.
> Animal cages of all shapes and descriptions have been used throughout history, but I wanted to
> implement something that would use a currently unused item in TFC – Burlap Cloth.
> The idea of carrying an animal this way was inspired by an Australian folk song “Waltzing Matilda”,
> where the swagman stuffed the jumbuck (sheep) into his tucker bag in order to steal it.

太长不读版：tucker bage可以让你在一个地方捕获动物，然后在另外一个地方把它放出来，相比于绳子，tucker bag不受地形限制，可以避免捕获过程中动物死亡或受伤。
