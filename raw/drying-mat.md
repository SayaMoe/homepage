# Introduction

The idea behind this mod came from a suggestion made by a forum member named Djakuta. His
suggestion was to create a Grass Mat to dry fruit.

Forum post - http://terrafirmacraft.com/f/topic/8266-grass-mat-dry-fruit/

This is the initial forum post -

This is just an idea for an addon. Is made in the hopes that someone with coding skills like it and
make it real.

The main concept is to be able to use a grass mat to create sun dried fruits.
Humankind has been drying fruits since stone age. It was a simple way to preserve food for the long
winters and also mixed with other ingredients a way to pack food for traveling.

There are several ways that we could achieve this in the game.

The Grass Mat can be made with:

- Regular grass
- Cat Tails
- Sea grass
- Rattan from a Palm Tree (Not yet in tfc)

Weaving the mat:

- Created in the Crafting Grid
- Using a mini game interface, similar the one in the weaving wool.

The Dry Fruit:

- raisins and other dry fruits stay edible for a long time.

Mechanics:

- Just spread the fruits on top of the grass mat up to 160 oz of any fruit per square mat.
- How long does it take for the fruit to dry? I think the best is to have a config option, it could be a minimum of 24 hours or even several 15 days.

Weather effects:

- If is raining fruits will not dry and if left under rain will actually spoil faster.
- Fruits need to be covered with another grass mat in case of rain, this stops the drying process and if left fruits will spoil.

太长不读版：

你可以做一个草垫来风干水果，默认设置下，需要把160oz水果放在一个草垫风干24小时。但如果下雨的话，就会导致风干失败，并加快变质。

万一下雨的时候，你可以使用另一个草垫去盖住水果，这会停止风干过程，而且依然会让留下的水果变质。

水果干可以保存较长一段时间。
